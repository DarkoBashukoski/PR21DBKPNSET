## Dataset Description

The topic we chose to analyze for this project is World Energy Consumption. The dataset we used can be found on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption

The dataset contains information on energy production and consumption for 242 different countries around the world, as well as what kind of fuel is used for the production of energy.
The data spans from the year 1900 until 2020 and contains 122 columns describing each countries energy consumptio and production for many different fuel types like Coal, Oil, Biofuel, Fossil Fuel, Nuclear, as well as renewable sources such as Solar, Wind and Water.
It also contains information about the population of a country for each year so its possible to compare the energy usage per person for each year.
Some of the more important attributes we are going to focus on will be:

`country` - Geographic location

`year` - Year of observation

`population` - Total population

`coal_consumption` - Primary energy consumption from coal, measured in terawatt-hours

`biofuel_consumption` - Primary energy consumption from biofuels, measured in terawatt-hours

`gas_consumption` - Primary energy consumption from gas, measured in terawatt-hours

`hydro_consumption` - Primary energy consumption from hydropower, measured in terawatt-hours

`nuclear_consumption` - Primary energy consumption from nuclear power, measured in terawatt-hours

`solar_consumption` - Primary energy consumption from solar, measured in terawatt-hours

`wind_consumption` - Primary energy consumption from wind, measured in terawatt-hours

`coal_production` - Coal production, measured in terawatt-hours

`gas_production` - Gas production, measured in terawatt-hours

`oil_production`  Oil production, measured in terawatt-hours

Also it is important to note that this data set is very messy and incomplete as not every country uses all forms of energy production, so there are a lot of null values in the data, meaning the data needs to be cleaned and filtered before use.

## Goals and question we would like to answer

With our analysis we would like to answer the following questions:

* How much energy consumption has increased over the years
* 
* Which countries use the most renewable energy sources and which ones do not
*
